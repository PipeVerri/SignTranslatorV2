# LSA-to-Text Translation – ML Explorations (WIP)

This repository contains a series of experiments and prototypes aimed at exploring the translation of LSA (Argentinian Sign Language) into glosses or Spanish text.  
It is an **ongoing** project focused on identifying which representations, models, and pipelines are most suitable for this task.

## Project Goal
Investigate different approaches to:
- Representing signs (images, keypoints, temporal sequences).
- Training recognition and translation models.
- Handling the scarcity of LSA datasets.
- Evaluating real-world model limitations when transitioning from curated data to continuous, in-the-wild scenarios.
- Document both successful and unsuccessful results (and the insights they provide).

## Experiments
The most interesting part of the project can be found in:

👉 **[`experiments/experiments.md`](experiments/Experiments.md)**

There you will find:
- Detailed descriptions of each experiment.
- Results, metrics, and progress updates.
- Success cases and major failures (including technical analysis).
- Comparisons between different architectures.
- Ideas for future improvements.
